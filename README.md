### HTpy: Early Development Preview

**HTpy** is a custom scripting language designed to transpile AHK-like syntax files into Python scripts. It allows users to write scripts using HTpy syntax and convert them into executable Python code.

**Note:** This project is still in its early stages of development.

#### Usage Example

Currently, HTpy supports a basic `msgbox` command. Here's an example of HTpy syntax:

```plaintext
msgbox, Hello HTpy!
```

#### Try It Out

You can experiment with HTpy syntax using the online demo [here](https://themaster1127.github.io/HTpy/).
